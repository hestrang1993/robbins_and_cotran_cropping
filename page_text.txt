[4Figure 1-7  Atherosclerosis, microscopic This cross-section of aorta shows a large overly -ing advanced atheroma containing numerous   cholesterol clefts, resulting from breakdown of   lipid imbibed into foam cells][ The luminal sur-face at the far left shows ulceration of its ˜brous   cap with hemorrhage][ Despite this ulceration,  which predisposes to mural thrombus forma - tion, atheromatous emboli are rare (or at least,   clinically signi˜cant complications from them are   infrequent)][ The thick medial layer is intact, and   the adventitia appears normal at the right][ As  atheromas become larger, they can be compli - cated by ulceration, which promotes overlying   thrombosis][ Organization of the thrombus further   increases the size of the plaque][ Figure 1-8  Atherosclerosis, microscopic This high-magni˜cation view of the necrotic   center of an aortic atheroma shows foam cells   () and cholesterol clefts ( )][ In the process of  atheroma formation, endothelial injury leads to   increased permeability, leukocyte adhesion, and   release of cytokines that attract blood mono - cytes, which become macrophages that accu - mulate lipids, becoming foam cells][ Macrophages   readily ingest oxidized LDL cholesterol through   their scavenger receptors][ Macrophages also   generate cytokines driving cellular recruitment][   An increased serum LDL level increases the   amount of oxidized LDL, promoting this process][   In contrast, HDL cholesterol tends to promote   mobilization of lipid in an atheroma and transport   to the liver][ Figure 1-9  Atherosclerosis, microscopic This severe degree of coronary arterial narrowing   results from smooth muscle cell migration and   proliferation within the intima to form an enlarging   ˜brofatty atheroma][ Shown here is a ﬁcomplexﬂ   atheroma, so designated because of the large   area of bluish calci˜cation at the lower right with   this H&E stain][ Complex atheromas can have   calci˜cation, thrombosis, or hemorrhage][ Calci˜ - cation would make coronary angioplasty to dilate   the lumen more dif˜cult][ Reducing the radius of   an artery by half increases the resistance to ˚ow   16-fold][ When the degree of narrowing is 70%   or more, angina is often present][ Such patients   are at great risk for acute coronary syndromes,   including myocardial infarction and sudden death   from dysrhythmias][ ]
[5Figure 1-10  Atherosclerosis, microscopic This coronary artery cross-section shows residual  smooth muscle in the media with overlying  atheroma composed of extensive lipid deposi - tion in lipophages () and a cholesterol cleft ( ) from breakdown of those cells][ Such plaques are   prone to rupture, hemorrhage, and thrombosis][   Platelets become activated and adhere to sites   of endothelial injury, then release cytokines such   as platelet-derived growth factor that promote   smooth muscle proliferation, and the adherent   platelet mass increases the size of the plaque   while narrowing the residual arterial lumen][ Use of   antiplatelet agents such as aspirin helps reduce   platelet ﬁstickinessﬂ and slows platelet participa- tion in atheroma formation][ Daily exercise is even   better][ Figure 1-11  Atherosclerosis, microscopic This coronary artery cross-section shows severe   occlusive atherosclerosis][ The atheromatous   plaque is circumferential and markedly nar -rows the remaining lumen][ Note the prominent   cholesterol clefts within this atheroma][ This   advanced atheromatous process involves the   arterial media () and the overlying intima () with numerous cholesterol clefts][ The remaining lumen   has become occluded by a recent thrombus ( ) that ˜lls it][ Thrombosis is often the basis for acute   coronary syndromes, including unstable angina,   sudden death, and acute myocardial infarction][ Figure 1-12  Atherosclerosis, CT image Contrast enhancement leads to an aortic lumen  () highlighted by bright attenuation of the blood, with darker gray mural thrombus seen around   the periphery of the lumen][ This abdominal aorta  has severe atherosclerosis, and it is slightly   dilated][ Mural thrombus can form atop advanced   atheromas, and thrombus can organize and nar -row the lumen further, or portions may break off   and embolize distally to occlude smaller arterial  branches in the systemic circulation][ This aortic   wall also has focal thin, bright areas of atheroma - tous calci˜cation][ (The left kidney is absent from   prior nephrectomy][ The right kidney is brightly   attenuated as intravenous contrast material ˚ows  through it][) ]
[6˜˚Figure 1-13  Atherosclerosis, angiogram This patient™s type 1 diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled for many  years, led to claudication (pain with exercise) in the right lower   extremity][ This angiogram reveals multiple areas of atherosclerotic   narrowing ( ) involving femoral arterial branches][ The upper leg with femur is in the left panel, and the lower leg with tibia and ˜bula is  in the right panel][ The arterial lumens appear dark with the digital  subtraction imaging technique shown here][ Figure 1-14  Atherosclerosis, angiogram  ˛There are multiple areas of atherosclerotic narrowing involving branches of the right   femoral artery in this patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus who developed   severe peripheral vascular disease with claudication][ On physical examination, peripheral   pulses are decreased or even absent with this degree of arterial occlusion][ The risk for   tissue ischemia and possible gangrenous necrosis is increased][ ˜˚Figure 1-15  Atherosclerosis, angiogram The degree of atherosclerotic narrowing ( ) in this right internal ca -rotid artery can produce mental status changes, including transient   ischemic attacks, which could presage a stroke from ischemia to   one or more areas of the brain][ On physical examination, a bruit   may be auscultated over such an area of large arterial narrowing,   caused by faster turbulent ˚ow of blood distal to the region of nar -rowing (Bernoulli principle)][ ]
[7Figure 1-16  Hyaline arteriolosclerosis,   microscopic Another form of arteriosclerosis (hardening of the  arteries) in addition to atherosclerosis is hya - line arteriolosclerosis, typically seen in kidneys   and brain][ It is shown here involving the mark - edly thickened arteriole at the lower right of this  glomerulus with PAS stain][ This change often   accompanies benign nephrosclerosis, leading to   progressive loss of nephrons and eventual renal   atrophy][ Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is also seen in   elderly individuals, who are often normotensive][   More advanced arteriosclerotic lesions may occur   in persons with diabetes mellitus or hypertension][Figure 1-17  Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis,  microscopic  The hyperplastic form of arteriolosclerosis is   prominent in this arteriole][ It has an ﬁonion skinﬂ   appearance from concentric, laminated intimal   and smooth muscle proliferation with marked nar -rowing of the arteriolar lumen][ Affected arterioles   also may undergo ˜brinoid necrosis (necrotizing   arteriolitis), and there may be local hemorrhage][   Surrounding tissues may show focal ischemia or   infarction][ This lesion is associated with malig - nant hypertension, with diastolic blood pressure  greater than 120  mm Hg][ Such malignant hyper-tension may occur de novo or may complicate  long-standing ﬁessentialﬂ hypertension][Figure 1-18  Medial calci˜c sclerosis,   microscopic Mönckeberg medial calci˜c sclerosis is the most   insigni˜cant form of arteriosclerosis (atherosclero - sis and arteriolosclerosis are signi˜cant because   of arterial luminal narrowing)][ It is more common   in the elderly][ Note the purplish blue calci˜ca - tions involving only the media; the lumen appears  unaffected by this process][ No signi˜cant clinical   consequences occur in most patients, and it is  usually an incidental ˜nding][ Recall this process   when you see calci˜ed muscular arteries on a  radiograph of the pelvic region, although other   regions such as the neck or breast may also be   involved][]
[8Figure 1-19  Aortic aneurysm, gross Atherosclerosis involving the intima and media  may focally weaken the wall of the aorta so that  it bulges out to form an aneurysm][ A classic  atherosclerotic aortic aneurysm typically occurs in   the abdominal portion distal to the renal arter -ies, as shown here ( )][ Aortic aneurysms tend to enlarge over time, and those with a diameter greater than 5 to 7  cm are more likely to ruptur e][ Aneurysms may also form in the larger arte- rial branches of the aorta, most often the iliac  arteries][ On physical examination, there may be   a palpable pulsatile abdominal mass with an ath- erosclerotic aortic aneurysm][ Increased expres - sion of matrix metalloproteinases that degrade   extracellular matrix components such as collagen  is observed in aortic aneurysms][Figure 1-20  Aortic aneurysm, gross This aorta has been sectioned longitudinally to  reveal a large abdominal atherosclerotic aortic   aneurysm distal to the renal arteries (at the right)   and proximal to the iliac bifurcation (at the left)][  This bulging aneurysm, 6 cm in diameter, is ˜lled  with abundant layered mural thrombus ( )][ Note the rough atheromatous surface of the aortic   lumen][Figure 1-21  Aortic aneurysm, CT imageContrast enhancement reveals an abdominal ath - erosclerotic aortic aneurysm that extends distal   to the level of the renal arteries past the takeoff   of the inferior mesenteric artery][ Note the bright   contrast material in the blood ˜lling the open  aortic lumen, whereas the surrounding mural   thrombus ( ) has decreased (darker) attenuation][  The total aortic diameter here is about 7 to 8  cm, in great danger of rupture][ A pulsatile abdomi - nal mass was palpable in this patient][ Although  atherosclerotic aneurysms are more common in   the abdominal aorta, they can also be found in  the thoracic aorta][]
[9˜˚Figure 1-22  Aortic dissection, gross There is an intimal tear ( ) located 7 cm above the aortic valve and proximal  to the great vessels in this aorta with marked atherosclerosis][ Risk factors for  this aortic dissection include atherosclerosis, hypertension, and cystic medial   degeneration][ When the tear occurs, the systemic arterial blood under  pressure can begin to dissect into the aortic media][ From there, the blood   may re-enter the aorta at a distal site through another tear, or it may dissect   through the wall of the aorta and rupture into adjacent tissues or body cavi - ties][ Proximal ruptures may reach the pericardial cavity, with hemopericardi - um][ There may be rupture into a pleural cavity, with hemothorax][ With distal   dissection, rupture into the abdominal cavity produces hemoperitoneum][ Figure 1-23  Aortic dissection, CT image ˛The contrast enhancement shows a dissection  involving the aortic arch][ The thin, dark linear seg - ments () mark extension of blood into the aortic media][ There is extension of this dissection to   involve the left common carotid artery][ Aortic dis - sections may be diagnosed with CT, transesoph - ageal echocardiography, MRI, or angiography][   Angiography is preferred before surgical repair][ ˜˚Figure 1-24  Aortic dissection, gross The right common carotid artery is compressed   by blood dissecting upward from a tear with   aortic dissection][ Blood may also dissect to  involve the coronary arteries][ Patients with aortic   dissection may have symptoms of sudden,  severe chest pain (for distal dissection) or may   demonstrate ˜ndings that suggest a stroke (with   carotid compression from proximal dissection)   or myocardial ischemia (with coronary arterial   compression from proximal dissection)][ Pain may   be absent in proximal dissections][ ]
[10Figure 1-25  Aortic dissection, microscopic This cross-section of aorta shows a red blood  clot splitting the media and compressing the   aortic lumen][ This occurred as a result of aortic   dissection in which there was a tear in the intima   of the aortic arch, followed by dissection of blood   at high pressure out into and through the mus - cular wall to the adventitia][ This blood dissecting  out can lead to sudden death from hemothorax,   hemopericardium, or hemoperitoneum][ Severe   knifelike chest pain may be present][ Figure 1-26  Aortic dissection, microscopic The tear () in this aorta extends through the  media, but blood also dissects along the media  ()][ Medical management can be undertaken; but with leakage or rupture, surgical repair of the dis - section can be performed with closure of the tear   and placement of a synthetic graft or endovascu- lar stent][Figure 1-27  Aortic dissection, gross This aorta opened longitudinally shows an area   in the thoracic portion of limited dissection that  is organizing within the media][ The red-brown   thrombus can be seen on both sides of the sec - tion as it extends around the aorta][ The intimal   tear would have been at the left][ This creates a   ﬁdouble lumenﬂ to the aorta][ This aorta shows  severe atherosclerosis, which was the major risk   factor for dissection in this patient][]
